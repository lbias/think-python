Like "homecoming" and "curfew", "popular" is one of those words we tend to associate with high school; and understandably so, since that's the era of our lives when social status can be a daily crushing concern. But even in the thick of those angsty teenage years, you probably sensed that there was much more to the whole popularity thing than just prom court and class geeks. Like all social dynamics, it's complicated.

Just how complicated is terrain tackled in a new book on the subject. Popular: The Power of Likability In A Status-Obsessed World, by Mitch Prinstein, digs into the data and research around what designates popularity, and why it's so definitional — not just in our early lives, but through adulthood. Prinstein, a professor and the director of clinical psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, divides the concept into two camps: status and likability.

Unsurprisingly, people tend to set their sights on the wrong one, which can wind up having major consequences not just for their social relationships, but also potentially for their health, too. We spoke to Prinstein about why the quest for status is ultimately one that leaves you lonely — and why being unpopular in high school is something you carry with you for literally the rest of your life.
